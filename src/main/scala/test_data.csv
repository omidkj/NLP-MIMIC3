Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 73843**] [**Known lastname **] is a 45 man with with a history of diabetes and ESRD on HD who was admitted on [**9-20**] with back pain and hypertensive urgency after missing an HD treatment. Initially in the ED, he was afebrile with a BP of 161/83. BP increased to 212/82 and was started on nitro gtt (titrated up to 50mcg/min). O2 sat fell to 80s and the patient was started on a NRB. Noted to be somewhat lethargic but oriented x3. Treated for hyperkalemia (k 7.0)and admitted to the ICU for hypertensive urgency. Of note, in setting of fall, had head CT which was negative, and L spine CT with nondisplaced L2-L3 fracture. The patient was seen by the orthopedics team with a recommendation that no acute intervention or bracing was necessary.  In ICU, the plan was initially for HD, however after initiating HD patient moved his arm and the AV fistula infiltrated, so dialysis could not be continued at that time.  The patient was managed with kayexalate and IV calcium, insulin.  HD was resumed the next day without complications.  The patient's electrolytes have remained stable.  He was placed back on his home regimen of anti-hypertensives with adequate control of his BP.  Of note, there was initial difficulty accessing the AV fistula with the above mentioned infiltration.  To evaluate the patency a fistulogram was obtained on [**9-25**] which showed no evidence of clot and patent flow.  The area where the intial infiltration occurred continues to improve.  The patient will be discharged with HD follow up tomorrow at his outpatient center.  At discharge the patient's potassium is 4.9. He will resume his Tu,Th,Sat HD tomorrow.  In regards to the patient's back pain, he has sustained the above mentioned non-displaced fractures that do not require surgical intervention at this time. He will be discharged on oxycodone for pain relief as well as a bowel regimen while receiving narcotics.  The patient has been instructed to follow up with his PCP if he develops any new neurological symptoms, worsening back pain or weakness.  Medications on Admission: 1. Aspirin 81 mg daily 2.

Status post left inguinal hernia repair. 7.  Colonoscopy in [**2149-3-29**] excisions of multiple polyps. 8.  Left heart catheterization in [**2144**], which showed an ejection fraction of 40 to 45% with inferior wall hypokinesis.  The right coronary is still obstructed.  Left main trunk showed 20%, left anterior descending coronary artery showed 20%, circumflex system was not defined.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 98.5.  HEENT examination was no lymphadenopathy, JVD or carotid bruits.  Lungs clear to auscultation.  Heart was respiratory rate with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdominal examination was unremarkable, but for diminished breath sounds.  Rectal examination showed good tone, no masses and guaiac negative stool.  Peripheral vascular examination shows feet warm without ulceration. There were no femoral bruits.  The examination pulse carotids were 2+ bilaterally, radial arteries were 2+ bilaterally, femorals were 2+ bilaterally, popliteals were absent.  The right dorsalis pedis was dopplerable signal.  The right posterior tibial was absent.  The left dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial were sent both by palpation on doppler signal.  Neurological examination oriented times three, grossly intact.  HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Vascular Service.  He was placed on triple antibiotics.  Pan cultures were obtained.  Noninvasives of the left leg were obtained, which demonstrated superficial femoral artery tibial disease and a patent aortobifemoral bypass graft.  Infectious disease was consulted regarding current antibiotic management. Gastrointestinal was consulted and considered upper endoscopy for identification of any disease.  The CTA was done, which showed a aortoenteric fistula at the third portion of the jejunum.  General Surgery was consulted (Dr.[**Name (NI) 1482**] [**Name (STitle) 4869**]).  Total parenteral nutrition was instituted.  A PICC line was placed.  Nutrition calculated his caloric needs to 1750 to 2050 calories, protein 70 to 90 grams protein per 24 hours.  The patient underwent on [**2150-3-2**] an axillary bifemoral bypass.  He was transferred to the VICU for continued care. On [**3-3**] the patient returned to surgery with excision of aortic graft and a left femoral axillary exploration and thrombectomy and a left profunda femoris thrombectomy.  The patient was returned to the Intensive Care Unit.  Intravenous heparin was begun.  Serial enzymes were obtained, because the patient's significant cardiac history, which demonstrated troponin level initially 0.13.  Echocardiogram was done, which showed an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%.  It was difficult to determine whether any new wall motion abnormalities.  Cardiology recommended aspirin, Lopressor, beta-blockade for a goal 60 pulse and a map less then 80, ace inhibitors.  The patient required continued ventilatory support and was transferred to the CICU for continued care.  The patient had an episodes of hypoxia on postoperative day two and one requiring reintubation.  The chest x-ray showed right lower lobe changes.  His J tubes were instituted on [**2150-3-5**].  The patient had a prolonged extended course in the CICU.  The patient was extubated on [**2150-3-11**].  He has had several episodes of ventricular tachycardia one with seven beat and one with a 17 beat.  On [**3-12**] gastrointestinal was consulted, because of gastrointestinal bloody drainage from his tube. He was transfused a unit of packed red blood cells. Endoscopy showed a small hiatal hernia, normal esophagogastroduodenoscopy to the third portion of the duodenum with some blood in the stomach.  Intravenous heparin drip was held.  On [**3-14**] the patient was finally extubated and transferred to the VICU for continued monitoring and care. He underwent an upper gastrointestinal series via the G tube, which demonstrated no leaks.  Physical therapy began to work with the patient.  His diet was advanced as tolerated. On [**2150-3-17**] EPS was requested to see the patient regarding his recurrent ventricular tachycardia.  They felt that he would require an AICD.  The pacemaker was functioning correctly that the AICD could be done on an elective basis after the patient has recovered from his current medical situation.  On [**2150-3-18**] the PICC line required tissue plasminogen activator to maintain patency.  Case management was requested to see the patient and began screening for rehab.  At the time of discharge the patient was in stable condition.  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.  Aspirin 325 mg q.d. 2.

He did require atropine and dopamine gtt in the ED. ECG showed idioventricular rhythm with slow response. Possible etiologies include electrolyte abnormalities. No evidence of infection on CXR and no fever or leukocytosis and therefore unlikely sepsis. He did report some mild diarrhea. The patient has mildly elevated trop in the setting of renal failure. No chest pain. Continued on aspirin. Home blood pressure meds initially held and then restarted once blood pressures stabilized. Blood cultures drawn and were pending at the time of discharge.  # ESRD: On M/W/F HD. Last dialysis was on Friday. See above for hyperkalemia. Renal consulted.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with a history of COPD and asthma, found by EMS tachypneic and lethargic after patient pressed her life-line activation of EMS.  She was brought to [**Hospital6 649**] E.D. where she was found to be hypercarbic and acidemic and was intubated for respiratory distress.  She was admitted to the ICU for management of respiratory failure and also found to be in acute and chronic renal failure with some component of congestive heart failure.  She was extubated on the second hospital day and was also found to be in metabolic acidosis, thought to be secondary to renal failure.  She tolerated extubation quite well in the ICU and had started treatment with I.V. steroids.  Her medical status improved and she was to be transferred to the floor.  Per family, the patient was feeling weaker and more fatigued over the past week and a home health aide found her to be more confused and lethargic on the day prior to admission to the hospital.

EXAM UPON PRESENTATION:  Temperature 98.1??????, blood pressure 170/92, pulse 86, respirations 26, and 96% on 2 liters.  In general, the patient is an elderly female lying in bed in no apparent distress.  HEENT reveals moist mucous membranes, nasal cannula in place.  Lungs were fairly clear to auscultation with minimal crackles and wheezes. Cardiovascular was regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, with positive bowel sounds.  The extremities showed 1+ edema bilaterally.  The neurological exam revealed cranial nerves that were intact.  Speech was fluent and comprehensible by relatives who understood [**Name (NI) 595**].  LABS UPON PRESENTATION:  White count of 10.3, hematocrit of 35.5, platelets 220, sodium 145, potassium 5.2, chloride 114, bicarb 22, BUN 52, creatinine 2.2, magnesium 1.9.  These labs were upon admission to the floor.  RADIOLOGICAL DATA:  Lower extremity non-invasive was negative for deep venous thrombosis.  Chest x-ray done many times showed congestive heart failure with minimal bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral bibasilar atelectasis versus infiltrate.  HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: 1.  SHORTNESS OF BREATH:  This was thought to be attributable to both the CHF exacerbation and the COPD exacerbation.  She was also thought to have questionable infiltrate, thus she was started on Levofloxacin.  For the CHF exacerbation, she was placed on furosemide with diuresis and kept on strict I&Os.  For COPD exacerbation, she was kept on prednisone 60 mg orally after two days of I.V. Solu-Medrol and appeared to do well.  She continued to have nebulizer treatments and her O2 sats were satisfactory upon room air.  2.  CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  The patient's baseline creatinine was approximately anywhere from 2.1 to 2.6.  The patient's creatinine did increase with diuresis, however did resolve by the time of discharge somewhat.  3.

An echocardiogram at an outside hospital showed new dilated cardiomyopathy.  He first noted symptoms on approximately the [**Hospital1 107**] Day weekend.  He described his symptoms as similar to asthmatic symptoms.  This progressed to severe orthopnea, a symptom he had no previously had causing him to sit upright and gasp for breath at night.  He used his friend's albuterol nebulizers with minimal improvement.  He denies lower extremity edema. His shortness of breath at this point was severely limiting his activity, walking 20 to 30 feet with severe dyspnea.  He felt better leaning forward.  He also describes decreased appetite.  At the beginning of [**Month (only) **] he saw his primary care physician who felt he was having an asthma exacerbation and gave him intravenous Solu-Medrol, and the patient relayed a vague story of going into sinus tachycardia with a heart rate in the 120s, a fingerstick in the 500s, been sent to the Emergency Department and admitted to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital. A chest x-ray showed a question of a left upper lobe pneumonia.  He was given intravenous antibiotics; ceftriaxone and azithromycin.  He was discharged from that hospital on [**7-7**].  An echocardiogram during that admission showed global hypokinesis, 4-chamber dilatation, an ejection fraction of 10% to 15%.  There were no previous echocardiograms.  The patient denies antecedent upper respiratory infection or recent diarrheal illness.  No rash.  No joint pains.  Denies a history of exertional chest pain, previous orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or lower extremity edema.  In the week between discharge from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital and admission to [**Hospital1 69**] he felt better with decreased dyspnea on exertion, increased exercise tolerance, and decreased lower extremity edema.  His blood pressure previously had been 130s to 190s; he would take it at work.  His cholesterol status is unknown.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1.  Newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy. 2.  Moderate mitral regurgitation. 3.  Global hypokinesis. 4.  Newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. 5.  Elevated liver function tests. 6.  Asthma; no previous steroids. 7.  Pneumonia, status post ceftriaxone and azithromycin.  MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Azmacort, NPH insulin 25 units q.a.m. and 10 units q.p.m., a course of Ceftin (ended on [**7-14**]).  SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives in [**Location (un) 23708**].  He has a human immunodeficiency virus positive partner (female), positive tobacco history times 20 years, previous heavy drinker (now social), very remote cocaine use.  FAMILY HISTORY:   One uncle with coronary artery disease and a sister with Grave's disease.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Pulse of 114, blood pressure of 122/88, 98% on room air. In general, he was a large man, in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat showed extraocular muscles were intact.  Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  The oropharynx was clear without lesions, 10 cm of jugular venous distention in the neck.  Lungs were clear to auscultation without crackles; however, decreased air movement was noted bilaterally.  Heart was fourth heart sound and first heart sound and second heart sound regular without murmurs.  The abdomen was obese. Sacral and abdominal wall edema.  Bowel sounds were present. It was soft.  Extremities showed 4+ edema, warm.  Neurologic examination was nonfocal.  PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count of 9.7, hematocrit of 39, mean cell volume of 88, platelets of 251.  Blood urea nitrogen of 16, creatinine of 0.8, glucose of 168.  AST of 79, ALT of 340, thyroid-stimulating hormone of 0.9, alkaline phosphatase of 186, albumin of 3.2, total bilirubin of 1.2.  RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Liver ultrasound from the outside hospital showed fatty infiltrate, no ascites, bilateral pleural effusions, normal portal flow.  Transthoracic echocardiogram at the outside hospital on [**7-6**] showed dilated left atrium of 5.6 cm, dilated left ventricle with severe global hypokinesis, ejection fraction of 10% to 15%, moderate mitral regurgitation, dilated right ventricle with moderate global dysfunction, mild tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary artery pressure in the 30s.  HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:  1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was noted to be in severe heart failure with dilated cardiomyopathy based on the outside hospital records, the etiology of which was unclear.  He was sent to the catheterization laboratory which revealed a middle left anterior descending artery lesion of 80%, status post stent.  The right coronary artery was totally occluded.  The left circumflex had a moderate ostial lesion which was not intervened upon.  His pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 35 mmHg to 40 mmHg.  His cardiac index was 1.4 L/kg/min/m2.  After catheterization, the patient was taken to the Coronary Care Unit with an intra-aortic balloon pump and was diuresed approximately 15 liters in the Coronary Care Unit with intravenous Lasix.  He was transferred back to the Cardiology Service for continued diuresis.  He was started on a heart failure regimen of captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d., Lasix 120 mg p.o. b.i.d., Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d., carvedilol 3.125 mg p.o. b.i.d.  He was also started on a statin, Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.  He was seen by the Electrophysiology Service for the possibility of receiving a prophylactic automatic internal cardioverter-defibrillator.  Given the fact that this was not an ischemic cardiomyopathy, it was felt that it was not indicated at this point.  2.  DIABETES:  He was continued on his diabetic regimen.  3.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  Electrolytes were repleted on a p.r.n. basis given his aggressive ongoing diuresis.  4.  DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient remained on the Cardiology Service as of [**7-18**].  An addendum to this Discharge Summary will be dictated by the incoming intern.
